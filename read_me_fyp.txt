To run this project:
(The intelli-J Ultimate Edition IDE was used in the development on Windows, however,
 intelliJ Community Edition and other IDEs such as Visual Studio code can also run it)

1)first install flutter:
windows: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
macOS: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos
Linux: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux

3) setup flutter SDK depending on the operating system
	(all the instructions to setup can be found in the links above)

4) In the IDE, install Flutter and Dart Plugins

5) Run an emulator and then run the "main.dart" file into that 
	emulator (andorid, iOS) to run the application

*sometimes there maybe issues with dependencies, so "flutter clean" command
 maybe run from the terminal of the IDE to get the dependencies
(or, first remove build folder, run flutter clean, then, run pub get)


AN APK FILE IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT FOLDER:
